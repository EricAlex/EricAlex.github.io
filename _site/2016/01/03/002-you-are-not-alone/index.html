				<h2 class="section-heading">Scene one:</h2>
<p>Can't even express herself clearly, but finally, 
she convinced herself by recalling a lot of irrelevant "examples" and by repeating her irrelevant and absurd points.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene two:</h2>
<p>"So, the new comer, what do you think so far, about what you've listened in this course?"</p>
<p>"I have not done enough research about you before this class. So can I ask you some questions first?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Are you a successful man? Because you see, if I want to become successful, 
I should only listen to a successful man and I mustn't hear a word from a unsuccessful man. 
everything related to the unsuccessful man can be the reason why he is not successful. I can not tell right from wrong and I needn't, 
the easiest way is following a successful man's steps, right? I can give a lot of examples of successful man or woman, 
big movie or TV Show stars, singers, young famous writers, businessman with great fortune, politicians with great power, even corrupt ones. 
A successful man is always right even I can't tell why, because I am too exited to think anything other than his great success. 
A unsuccessful man is always wrong even I can't tell why, 
because there is an old saying that the reason why a unsuccessful man is unsuccessful must lay in himself. 
I can't tell whether the old saying is right or wrong, but old saying is old saying, right? 
It survived successfully through time and it was said so many times that it became the truth. So I believe it. 
Actually I don't care about the truth, it will cost me too much time to think, why not use the time to pursuit my success? 
So I think that thinking is the biggest enemy of success and happiness. Do you know what I learned from the successful man? 
Do not think, just pursuit your success and happiness. Do you know my definition  of happiness? Eat and sleep happily like a pig. 
Maybe 'pig' is not the most proper term for this, but I don't care. Though I don't know how to tell right from wrong, 
I know how to tell successful man from unsuccessful man in most occasions. 
I can even predict one men's success using my knowledge of psychology. Yes you heard me, I know psychology, 
I even created a term named "Psychological strong" but left it undefined so I can use it wherever I want. 
Those who dressed well and can't stop talking, no matter right or wrong, shows good EQ and "Psychological strong", successful man! 
or at least will be successful! Talking about terms, I bet you can't create more terms than I did. Oh! Talking so much about "successful", 
I didn't defined it yet, did I? I like money, power and material enjoyment, to be frank. 
So my definition of success will be a lot of money and material enjoyment and great power."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see, to answer your question, the success course is next door."</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene three:</h2>
<p>In fact, she is so good at convincing herself that all she has to do is pretending she is convinced emotionally. 
And that is what she called "Psychological strong".</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene four:</h2>
<p>No foreground performance, no strategy behind the scene, just silly weird acting. How ignorant and shameless.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene five:</h2>
<p>Sina killed himself when swabbing his rifles.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene six:</h2>
<p>She was expecting applause when showing her ignorance, but she didn't asked herself why should people applause for that. 
She always forget questioning herself anything, let alone questioning others. 
But she laughed and was amused by acting like a fool and hoped to amuse partners walking along with her. 
Her partners indeed laughed thinking showing ignorance is a gesture less aggressive. That is what her friendship based on.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Scene seven:</h2>
<p>We've heard a lot of dogs' barking, especially when they are herded together. But deep inside, we wish to see their bite skills, 
as ancient Romans did, if our barbarous part haven't died out yet.</p>
