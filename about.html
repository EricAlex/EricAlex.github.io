<p>A doctoral student of Zhejiang University specialize in structural geology. 
    He developed a system (<a href="https://github.com/EricAlex/structrock">GitHub repository</a>) 
    that acquire and analyze fracture data from point clouds from outcrop LiDAR surveys, 
    capable of correcting and analyzing errors from regular sampling methods. 
    He is now working on the physical modeling of fracturing, folding and faulting. 
    With a background in Remote Sensing and GIS, he is also seeking some breakthrough in processing remote sensing and GIS data, 
    especially when he has obtained some experiences in processing large data sets and developing softwares.</p>
